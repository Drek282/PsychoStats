will properly track for players and maps.
+ Added 'round_win' event trigger for 'dod' servers.
+ Directory structure has changed a bit to try and make it less confusing
for users. The 'upload' directory contains all files meant to be uploaded to
a website (this used to be called 'web'). Everything else stays local.
+ The 'live servers' configuration has been moved into it's own table to 
make it easier to manage.
* Fixed bug with installer on step 1. Incorrectly saying mysql 4.1.11 was
too low when in fact it's the minimum.

being delegated properly.

if a non-standard module is not present or if Perl is too old.
* Tweaked some events in Game/halflife.pm
* Fixed language encoding problem in certain parts of the theme.
(UTF8 characters were not encoded correctly).

loops on some systems due to bad file paths.
* Fixed a DB query that greatly affected the load times of the main
player index and possibly other listings on the stats web pages.
* Fixed some player stats from not being saved properly. This would cause
some players to have slightly lower stats than what the logs actually reflect.
* A couple more tweaks to the Installer that adds more logic for minimum
requirements and less confusion when tables already exist.
* DOD player bonuses have been added to the default config and confirmed
working.
* Updated DOD theme pieces to include some missing DOD specific information.

Version 3.0.3 beta (2007-02-03)

initialization step. Also made step 6 (compiled themes) more robust to 
allow users to change the path and have better permission checking.

warnings for unknown events and enabling partial week awards.

* Unknown column 'lastdecay' in 'field list' -- Error fixed. the database
schema included in the previous release was missing this field.

Version 3.0.0 beta (2007-02-02)
* Not all features and changes have been mentioned below *
+ Recoded object hierarchy to be scalable, easily sub-classed and to separate 
functionally. Lots of work went into the recoding and structure, too many
to list here.
+ All configuration is stored in the database with the exception of basic
DB settings in the stats.cfg. This will allow for 100% web based GUI setup.
+ logsource's can be local directories, or remote FTP or SFTP sites
(Note: SFTP requires Net::SSH::Perl to be installed).
+ Implemented player/clan 'profile' support. If stats are reset players
and clans will retain their personal profiles when the stats are recreated.
+ Implemented full UTF-8 support. This requires MYSQL v4.1+
+ Implemented Real-Time clantag detection for players.
+ Implemented Real-Time 'most used' player name selection. 
+ Implemented better state persistence for log scanning so logs are only 
scanned once for each source configured.
+ Implemented a better 'kill skill' calculation. Still using the ELO method
however, a players total online time is now taken into account. The more 
online time you have the less points you give/receive for kills.
* Re-coded the DB stats routines (again). They are now simplier, and about
15% faster than before.
+ Implemented IP to Country lookups. The players country flag will be shown
in player listings within the stats. Flag images credit goes to 
http://flags.blogpotato.de/
+ Implemented 'user' profile support. Users are registered and linked to a 
player for login. The user system is flexable and will allow for easier
integration within existing sites.
+ Implemented extensible admin controls. New admin 'controls' can be dropped
into place w/o any changes in existing PHP code.
+ Enhanced "Live server view" to allow multiple servers all on 1 page and
w/o causing the page to 'lag out'. RCON queries are also allowed for admins.
+ Enhanced player searching to match on player IP's and name aliases.
+ Implemented uploadable plr/clan icon support. Upload from users computer
or from another URL.
+ Implemented player session histories. Each player has their previous 
online sessions saved and can be viewed separately from their overall
stats. A 'session' is the length of time the player was logged in, even
between map changes.
+ Removed some logic from the default theme to make it a little less complex
on some pages.
+ Implemented an advanced admin config editor. The admin config editor is 
dynamic and very easy to use. New settings in the database are automatically
discovered by the editor w/o any changes to the themes or other code.
+ Implemented several more Admin Control Panel features, like logsource 
editing and other tweaks.
+ Implemented a 'daily' process trigger for stats updates. Daily processes
are generally run once, or possibly several times a day to calculate certain
stats, ranks, trim histories or clean up the clan listings.
+ Implemented daily process: player ranks.
+ Theme updated to show a players rank difference going up or down.
+ Enhanced PHP session support to recognize Web "robots" (ie: google, yahoo)
and disable the auto appending of session ID's in the HTML output. This will
help search engines to properly index your stats pages.
+ Implemented daily process: clan rules
+ Implemented daily process: players rules
+ Implemented player bonuses. Ie: assign extra points to players (or teams 
of players) based on different events like 'target_bombed'. Fully web 
configurable. Note: this has nothing to do with AWARDS. 
+ Enhanced clantag support. different tags can be matched and combined into 
a single clan entity automatically.
+ Implemented awards. The awards system uses a plugin architecture to allow
for more complex awards. Currently basic player action and weapon awards
are present.
+ Implemented player aliases.
+ Implemented an easy to use online installation process.
+ Implemented 'maxdays' feature! -- Old stats are removed automatically.
+ Added 'maxdays_exclusive' option: If enabled, compiled stats are reduced
when old stats are removed. If disabled the compiled stats continue to 
increase regardless of old stats being removed.
+ Implemented automatic scheduling of 'daily' updates when stats.pl is
run. So using the -daily command line manually is optional.
+ All dynamically created images (charts and graphs) are now fully 
customizable via an external XML config file.
+ Implemented automatic player bans from log events (incomplete).
+ Implemented manual player bans. Wildcard support included. Ban players
by steamid, IP or name.
+ Implemented fully functional DECAY system for decaying player skill
over long periods of inactivity.
+ Implemented full Day of Defeat:Source support. Including detailed stats
based on team roles.
+ Google Maps API support implemented for player world locations based on
their IP address. This is never 100% accurate, but it's good enough.
+ New hitbox flash animation included with default theme. Fully 3D!
+ HL2DM support added (classic HLDM should work the same)
+ Implemented Feeder::stream to allow log streams from remote game servers. 
NOTE: This feature is currently experimental and is not fully fleshed out.
